career-profile:
    summary: |
      My research goal is to develop computationally and data-efficient machine learning models and algorithms for real-world applications, grounded in meta-learning and meta-modeling. I am particularly interested in extending these approaches to natural language processing, self-supervised learning, dataset condensation, hyperparameter optimization, AI safety, privacy, and multi-modal learning.
